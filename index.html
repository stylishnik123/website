        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>Smart Cities focus on their most pressing needs and on the greatest opportunities to improve lives. They tap a range of approaches - digital and information technologies, urban planning best practices, public-private partnerships, and policy change - to make a difference. They always put people first.

            The Smart Cities Mission is a civic recycling and improvement program of the Government of India, which aims to develop 100 cities on permanent basis in the entire country. The Union Urban Development Ministry, in collaboration with the state governments of those cities, has to carry out the mission. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Government of India has set a goal of developing 100 cities in the big cities as sub-cities or modernizing the medium-sized cities. 

            In the first phase, states and Union Territories nominated 100 potential cities. The evaluation of their development plan as smart city has been done by the top committee of the Ministry of Urban Development in the second phase and selected for the first 20 cities based on merit, in the financial year 2015-16, finance is provided. Other cities were asked to participate in the competition in the next two phases after removing the errors found in planning. In the next two stages, 40 cities each will be selected for financing.</p>

        <h3>Continuing awareness</h3>

        <p>The Smart Cities Mission is an innovative Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) to drive economic growth and improve the quality of life of people by enabling local development and harnessing technology as a means to create smart outcomes for citizens. The Central Government proposed to provide financial support to the Mission to the tune of Rs. 48,000 crores over five. The Mission will cover 100 cities and its duration will be five years (FY2015-16 to FY2019-20). The scheme is administered by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Government of India.
            </p>
        <p>As per Census 2011, cities accommodate nearly 31% of India’s population and contribute 63% of GDP. Urban areas are expected to house 40% of India’s population and contribute 75% of India’s GDP by 2030. This requires comprehensive development of physical, institutional, social and economic infrastructure. These are important in improving the quality of life and attracting people and investment, setting in motion a virtuous cycle of growth and development.</p>
